Hello World, I'm going to create cool things with people that matter!

I'm a computer science GEEK trying to make the world a better place with distributed, social, mobile, local, cloud-sourced blockchain file branchingin realtime with data analytics. 

My favorite food is moon tacos, I find them far superior to Earth tacos.

If you're reading this, say hi! Let's eat moon tacos together :)!
